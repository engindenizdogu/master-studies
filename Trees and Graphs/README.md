# Problem Sets
This repository contains problem sets related to trees and graphs for the Master of Science in Data Science program taught by University of Colorado, Boulder. Each assignment focuses on specific topics and challenges related to computational complexity, correctness, and practical implementations.

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 1
  - Implementation of Binary Search Trees
  - Functions for searching, inserting, deleting and finding tree height 

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 2
  - Depth First Search (DFS) implementation for undirected graphs
  - DFS traversals
  - Finding Strongly Connected Components (SCC) and cycles in a graph

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 3
  - Implementation of Union-Find data structure with rank compression
  - Finding Strongly Connected Components (SCC) using Union-Find data structures
  - Kruskal's Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 4
  - Given a maze as an image, we solve the shortest path problem using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The image is represented as a graph where each pixel of the image is a vertex and edges connect a pixel to its neighbor (opencv library was used for image processing)
  - This implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm was written in a way that it doesn't create an adjacency list/table. Instead, weights are updated as the algorithm progress
