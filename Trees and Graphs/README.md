# Problem Sets
This repository contains problem sets related to trees and graphs for the Master of Science in Data Science program taught by University of Colorado, Boulder. Each assignment focuses on specific topics and challenges related to computational complexity, correctness, and practical implementations.

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 1
  - Implementation of Binary Search Trees
  - Functions for searching, inserting, deleting and finding tree height 

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 2
  - Depth First Search (DFS) implementation for undirected graphs
  - DFS traversals
  - Finding Strongly Connected Components (SCC) and cycles in a graph

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 3
  - Implementation of Union-Find data structure with rank compression
  - Finding Strongly Connected Components (SCC) using Union-Find data structures
  - Kruskal's Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 4
