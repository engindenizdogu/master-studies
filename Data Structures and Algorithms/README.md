# Problem Sets
This repository contains problem sets related to algorithms and data structures for the Master of Science in Data Science program taught by University of Colorado, Boulder. Each assignment focuses on specific topics and challenges related to computational complexity, correctness, and practical implementations.

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 1
  - Understanding algorithm correctness
  - Analyzing running time complexity
  - Notations: O, big-Omega, and big-Theta
  - Proving correctness using inductive invariants
  - Merge Sort correctness proofs

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 2
  - Basic data structures
  - Heap data structures
  - Practical applications of heaps and arrays

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 3
  - Partitioning techniques
  - Universal hash functions

## Topics Covered in Problem Set 4
  - Using a count-min sketch, the frequency of words with a length of 5 or more in "The Great Gatsby" and "War and Peace" is estimated
  - A bloom filter is used to estimate how many words from "War and Peace" already appears in "The Great Gatsby."
